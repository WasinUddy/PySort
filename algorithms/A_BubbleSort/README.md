# Bubble Sort Algorithm

## Overview

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated for every element in the list until the list is sorted.

## How It Works

1. **Iterative Process**: Starting from the first element of the list, the algorithm compares it with the next element.
2. **Comparison**: If the current element is greater than the next element, they are swapped. If not, the algorithm moves to the next pair of elements.
3. **Pass Completion**: After the first pass, the largest element will have "bubbled up" to the last position in the list.
4. **Repetition**: The algorithm then starts again from the first element, but this time it goes up to the second last element (since the last element is already in its correct position). This process is repeated, reducing the length of the unsorted portion of the list by one with each pass.
5. **Completion**: The algorithm stops when it completes a pass without making any swaps, indicating that the list is fully sorted.

## Key Characteristics

- **In-Place**: Bubble Sort only requires a constant amount of extra memory (for element swapping), so it's an in-place sorting algorithm.
- **Stable**: Elements that are equal will remain in their original order.
- **Performance**: It has an average and worst-case time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of items being sorted. For small datasets or nearly sorted datasets, it can be efficient, but it is generally not suitable for large datasets.
- **Adaptive**: If during a pass, no swaps are made, it indicates the list is sorted, and the algorithm can break early, making it adaptive.

## Use Cases

- Suitable for small datasets or datasets that are nearly sorted.
- Useful for educational purposes due to its simplicity.
- Not recommended for performance-critical applications or large datasets.

## Conclusion

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand and implement. While it's not the most efficient for large datasets, its conceptual simplicity makes it a popular choice for introductory computer science courses.
